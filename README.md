⚙️ Setup Instructions
📦 1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/Nivas2004/prou-fullstack-assessment.git
cd prou-fullstack-assessment

🎨 Frontend Setup (React)
1️⃣ Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

2️⃣ Configure Firebase

Create:
frontend/src/firebase.js

import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);

3️⃣ Set Backend URL

Inside: frontend/src/api.js

export const API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000";

⚙️ Backend Setup (FastAPI)
1️⃣ Create virtual environment (optional)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Add environment variables

Create file: backend/.env

MONGO_URL = your-mongodb-url
DB_NAME = inventorydb

3️⃣ Start Backend Server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload


Backend runs on:

http://127.0.0.1:8000


To see API docs:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

🧪 API Endpoints
Products
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/products/	Add product
GET	/products/user/{userId}	Get all products for user
GET	/products/{id}/{userId}	Get one product
PUT	/products/{id}/{userId}	Update product
DELETE	/products/{id}/{userId}	Delete product
🖼 Screenshots (Add When Uploading)

MongoDB Collection

FastAPI Docs

🧩 Assumptions

Every user manages only their own inventory data.

Authentication is handled fully using Firebase.

Backend does not manage user accounts (only receives userId).

UI focuses on clarity and usability.

🏁 Bonus Features Implemented

Firebase authentication

Protected APIs with user ownership checks

CSV Export

Responsive UI

Complete full-stack integration
